As an average Lagosian, traffic is a perennial concern, come 5:00pm at close of work, I begrudgingly search out my car in the parking lot and consign myself to an evening of crawling in 1-hr traffic to cover a distance that ordinarily should take 15-mins. I propose that a poor spread of events/attractions across the state of Lagos contributes to the traffic problem. Most restaurants, clubs, art galleries, and shopping malls are located in only a select few cities. I feel that other similarly small sized states have been able to manage their traffic problem by intentionally locating sites of attraction across multiple cities such that residents are surrounded by more than 1 option for weekend amusement. Using geospatial data on Foursquare, I would like to compare the availability and variability of recreational sites between major cities/neighborhoods in Boston & Lagos and see if there is any significant differences that may help to inform a policy/plan to foster more strategic city planning in Lagos. Thus, my data analysis will beneficial particularly for urban planning specialists, government bodies and contractors
