I will be using data on venues within the top 8 most populated neigborhoods in Boston & Lagos. I can get Local govt area specific population data for Lagos from: (https://www.citypopulation.de/php/nigeria-admin.php?adm1id=NGA025) The Lagos data contains population projections for 2016 as its most recent data. Boston neighborhood specific data can be sourced (https://statisticalatlas.com/place/Massachusetts/Boston/Population) from Google. I will compare the total numbers of recreational venues of each neighborhood to calculate availability. I will then compare the variety in recreational venues available within the cities i.e; bowling, art center, museum, parks etc. to compute variability. These two metrics should help me establish a difference if any exist between the availability and variability of sites of attraction for Lagos residents and for Boston residents
